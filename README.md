# Large Language Models APIs â€“ Chemical Safety Checker

This project demonstrates how to use **OpenAIâ€™s API** to analyze the safety of consumer products by checking their ingredients for **harmful or carcinogenic chemicals**.  

The example notebook (`Large_language_model_api.ipynb`) shows how to input a product and its list of ingredients and receive an AI-generated assessment of:
1. Harmful or carcinogenic chemicals found  
2. A short explanation for each chemical  
3. Whether the overall product is generally considered safe
